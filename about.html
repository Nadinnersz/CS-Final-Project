        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p id="para2">I am Nadinne Chloe J. Montes, a grade 9 student from the Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus whose goal was to alleviate under-privileged families. The Youth Poverty Advocacy Group (YPAG) is an association with a goal to spread awareness about the causes and effects of poverty as well as informing the public on the possible solutions that can be implemented.</p>
    <br>
        <p id="para3">This group started in 2016 where numerous Philippine Science High School scholars saw the number of families who lived in poverty and decided to establish the YAPG with the core values of passion, empathy, and creating an inclusive community. </p>
    <br>
        <p id="para3">As this association grew, we decided to open new member slots from outside the PSHS SMC to different schools in Mindanao and even in Luzon and Visayas. In the present, we have around 5000 of us youth ready to serve our nation and speak about certain issues that lead to the never-ending poverty of the Philippines.</p>

    <h1 class="para">Why Poverty?</h1> 
    <p>Since I was I kid, I have always thought of, “What if I was born to an underprivileged familiy, would I still be here?” If I were to answer to that question now, it would be no. Without the efforts of my family for me to get into Pisay such as going to a review center, I wouldn’t have passed. Because of that, I now have this privilege of going to one of the top high school here in the Philippines for free. Opportunities here cannot be attained anywhere else and I will always be grateful for that. Now, I go back and think of the people who are twice as talented as me but did not have enough resources, how unfortunate would it be to waste a student like that. I have seen people with the biggest aspirations in life but struggle to have the financial means for it. Although they are students, they worry more about their finances instead of studying more.
    <br> </br>They struggle to eat thrice a day and and choose to not eat with the use of their pocket money just for them to have the fare to go home. I know people that are smarter than me but because of the lack of resources they have, all those talents are wasted. Some students are forced to drop out for labor and help provide for their families. Don’t they also have dreams?
    <br> </br>There, I realized how poverty affects one’s future and life. The struggles they face are often overlooked and is not talked often. People should be aware of the factors that leads to poverty, how to avoid it, and how to help these people. Think about the millions of Filipino children who dropped out of school just to provide for their families which disables them to attain education. Education can have a troll in someone’s life and this right should prioritize the unprivileged people first.
    <br> </br>Going back to the question , “Why poverty?”. In my opinion, poverty makes basic human rights become a privilege. Basic human rughts such as food, healthcare, education, proper snaitation, clean water and more becomes a privilege to them, which should not be the case. Specifically, child poverty, these children did not choose to be born with these circumstances. It is not their fault that they cannot attain education, and because of poverty, they are forced to labor. Therefore, I advocate for child poverty where education should be accessible despite your financial status.</p>

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p id="para2">I am Nadinne Chloe J. Montes, I am 14 years old and a student in the Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus (PSHS-SMC). I came from a comfortable family where we didn’t need to worry about providing basic necessities for survival but I did grow up seeing a lot of people suffering from poverty. </p>
<br></br>
    <p id="para3">When I was a kid, I saw their challenges and difficulties and at that time, I could not understand why. I wanted to know why they still live in poverty despite working so hard and I wanted to help alleviate their problems. When I got to the PSHS-SMC, I discovered that we were able to join organizations and even make your own based on your own advocacy.</p>
<br></br>
    <p id="para3">I was so glad that we have this kind of program and support which we are able to give back to the community. And so, this is one way in helping alleviate that problem, by creating a website to spread awareness.</p>
