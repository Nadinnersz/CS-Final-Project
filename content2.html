    <h2>The Root Cause</h2>
    <img class="image" src="poverty6.ong.png" alt="Community">
    <p class="text">In the Philippines, especially parents that work in poor areas, they find themselves trapped in poor work conditions and low paychecks. These regions lack to offer the people stable jobs with decent wages, contributing more to child poverty. Not only that but the lack of access to quality education and healthcare are factors of inequality as children in poor areas cannot attain basic education because of lack of school supplies, transportation issues, and run down classrooms where attaining basic healthcare still remains a dire challenge. Rural areas of this country do not have equal opportunities to its citizens unlike those in the city area which remains a contributing factor to cold poverty. When natural disasters come, it can displace families, ruin their homes, and halt education.

    <h2>The Effects</h2>
    <img class="image1" src="engage.png" alt="Community">
    <p class="text">The effects of the number of people in poverty does not only affect the individual itself but also the community it has. One example of it is elevated dropout rates, where a country has a high drop out rate, meaning to say its education system is failing to keep its students which leads to a less prosperous society. Another thing is limited access to proper nutrition, where most of the children who live in poverty face malnutrition. Not only does it limit their physical growth, but poverty can also affect their mental health, in a way that when kids are dealing with this kind of circumstance, they often feel stressed and worried. Most of them feel the burden to get their family out of poverty at such a young age, leading to many children dropping out of school to go to work. </p>
