    <h1>What Do These Children Actually Go Through?</h1>
    <p class="text2">These are some testimonials of children in poverty where they share their circumstances and what they have to go through in life. Through these stories, it will help us understand their pain, challenges, and empathize with them a bit more. These are not just stories of a few people but millions who have to suffer through these kinds of circumstances everyday. One act of kindness can already help lift the burden they have had.</p>

        <p>“My name is Mercedes. I am 16 years old. I came from a poor family in Dar es Salaam. I am the second child among six children. One died the day she was delivered by my mother in this world. This sad death of my sister was caused by the bad health of my mother while she was pregnant and also due to severe poverty. My father died of sickness when I was still young, before starting my primary school. Since we depended most on him, his death became a disaster in our family and my mother was left alone to work and bring us food. I was not even expecting to continue with my secondary education.”</p>

    <div class="con1">
        <p>Abet started working in sugarcane farms at age 10. To bring extra income for her family, Abet toiled away despite her small and frail body. She never stopped since then. From earning P50 per day as a child, her wages increased to P150 per day as an adult. Still barely enough, Abet worries that her children might fall into a similar faith. Due to child poverty, Abet and her seven siblings were not able to finish school. Forced to work at an early age, Abet felt she had no choice but to drop out. “But I won’t let that happen,” said Abet in Bisaya. “My mother was also a sugarcane farmer like me. I want my sons to have the power to choose what they want to be.”

        <p>She was born in 1979 and has seven siblings. She was the second child. They lived in a rural area with no electricity and proper housing. Her mother was a housewife, while her father had no permanent job. She described their situation back then as hard and pitiful. They were already thankful if there were dried fish or sardines on the table. But since there were many mouths to feed, a piece of dried fish was divided for two persons. And if there was nothing, they would find a coconut, scrape it, and mix it with the rice so that everybody could eat.</p>

    <h2>Statistics on Philippine Child Poverty</h2>
    <img class="image" src="poverty3.png" alt="Community">
    <p class="text">Child poverty in the Philippines remains a pressing concern that affects children’s physical and mental development. While the overall poverty rate in the country has declined, the child poverty rate continues to increase. According to a 2022 policy research report by the World Bank and UNICEF, approximately 5.14 million Filipino children—about 12.4%—live in extreme poverty. (Sheidu, 2025) </p>
    <p>Low household income remains a key driver of child labor. To support their families, many children either drop out of school or divide their time between work and school. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), in 2023, around 1.09 million children aged 5 to 17 were working and 678,000 of them were not eligible to work legally. Although the number of working children has decreased from previous years—935,000 in 2021 and 828,000 in 2022—child labor remains a significant concern. Many children leave school due to financial hardship, creating a cycle of poverty that could persist across generations. (Sheidu,2025)</p>

    <h2>Global Statistic on Child Poverty</h2>
    <img src="Space Earth GIF.gif" alt="poverty GIF style=" style="width:300px; float:right; padding:10px;">
    <p class="text">According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), more than 400 million children globally live in poverty, missing out on at least two daily needs such as nutrition and sanitation. The highest rates of multidimensional poverty among children are concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In Chad, for example, 64 per cent of children face two or more severe deprivations, and just under 25 per cent face three or more.  
                    Sanitation is the most widespread severe deprivation, with 65 per cent of children lacking access to a toilet in low-income countries, 26 per cent in lower-middle income countries, and 11 per cent in upper-middle income countries. A lack of adequate sanitation can increase children’s exposure to diseases.
